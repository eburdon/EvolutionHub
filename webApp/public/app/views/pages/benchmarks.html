	<p> We're looking to collect information on open source projects currently in development! We're hoping to analyze their current phase and compare them to other projects. At the end of the day, we hope to be able to offer a methodology or tool anyone can apply to their project in order to evaluate its current status.</p>

	<p>The first challenge we expect is, of course, collecting relevant information. Who will let us study their repository? </p>

	<p>The second more significant issue is not being able to know ahead of time where a project is going. By this we mean, will be become hugely complex or stay modular? Will be be geared towards the general public or is it a program designed for a specialized niche of professionals? How can we properly assess where in the evolutionary stage a project is in if we can never assume what the end stage will be?</p>

	<p>Like we said - we need your help. Visit this project's repository and leave an comment/issue with suggestions on how we can tackle evolutionary benchmarking, or leave a link to your repository so we can analyze it! No matter what, we'll reply to you as soon as we can. </p>
