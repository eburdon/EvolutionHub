	<h1>About this project</h1>
	
	<p>This application is our final deliverable for project 2 of UVic's Software Evolution Course. Cool, right?!</p>

	<p>Project 1 was to analyze different open-source codebases and answer questions related to evolution such as "Do software development methods, such as agile or waterfall, affect the long-term evolution of a project?" or "Does the amount of funding affect the number of features in a project?"</p>

	<p>This application hopes to successfully bring all of the student-created tools into one place. In our Research Center, you can execute the tool server-side, and have the results displayed right in your browser! In the Edcuation Center, you can learn all about the laws of software evolution, attempt to evaluate where your project is the evolutionary process, or follow a couple of cool links for more information.

	<h3>Erika Burdon</h3>
	<p>Erika is a fourth year Software Engineering student born and raised on Vancouver Island! An island girl at heart, Erika loves to go camping (rain or shine!), read up on new technology, or just fiddle around with new programming concepts, ideas, and languages. She knows American Sign Language, and German. <br>
	<b>Fun Fact: </b> She's deaf, so talk loud. Or email her. Whichever you prefer.</p>

	<h3>Fraser DeLisle</h3>
	<p>Silly Fraser - He hasn't written anything about himself yet. </p>
	<b>Fun Fact: </b> He's got big boots. I mean, like <i>really</i> big. They're somewhat terrifying. But don't worry - take the time to talk to him and you'll see what a nice guy he really is.</p>

	<h1>Future work</h1>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Continue with <b>Benchmarking</b> project idea and determine which evolutionary stage a project is in</li>
		<li>Ask development team to write summaries for their projects</li>
		<li>Ask development teams to format ALL their tool results in a visual manner so it's easy to display as a part of this application</li>
		<li>Add more projects to the research center</li>
		<li>Keep adding content to the education center</li>
		<li>Better application styling/design</li>
	</ul>
