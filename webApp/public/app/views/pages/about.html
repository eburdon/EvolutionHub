	<h1>About this project</h1>
	
	<p>This application is our final deliverable for project 2 of UVic's Software Evolution Course. Cool, right?! This page includes all of the remaining information that needs to be included such as: project description, threats to validity, project management, future work, and conclusion.</p>

	<h3>Background info:</h3>
	<p>Leading up to Project 1, our class discussed the evolution of ultra-large scale systems (ULSS) and how they've evolved over time. We also looked at some different code bases, read a few essays by Fred Brooks (re: "Mythical Man Month"), and learnt about the 8 Laws of Evolution.</p>

	<p>
	For project 1, each student was asked to build some sort of tool. They had to study a code base and answer questions about Software Evolution. Questions such as "Do software development methods, such as agile or waterfall, affect the long-term evolution of a project?" or "Does the amount of funding affect the number of features in a project?" were asked and answered.
	</p>

	<h3>Current info:</h3>
	<p>This is our project 2, a web application that hopes to successfully bring all of the above student-created tools into one place. One cohesive evolution hub! It's split into two major areas: the Research Center and Education Center.</p>

	<p>
	In our Research Center, you can execute any tool server-side and have the results displayed right in your browser! In the Education Center, you can learn all about the 8 Laws, attempt to evaluate where your project is in the overall evolutionary process, or follow a couple of cool links for more information.

	<p>You can read more about this project in its <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/eburdon/EvolutionHub">GitHub repository.</a> Be sure to check out the <b>wiki</b> which includes our detailed project plan, worklog, and other project management info.</p>

	<h3>Erika Burdon</h3>
	<p>Erika is a fourth year Software Engineering student born and raised on Vancouver Island! An island girl at heart, Erika loves to go camping (rain or shine!), read up on new technology, or just fiddle around with new programming concepts, ideas, and languages. She knows American Sign Language and German. <br><br>
	<b>Fun Fact: </b> She's deaf, so talk loud. Or email her. Whichever you prefer.</p>

	<h1>Project management</h1>
	<p>
	In class, we were asked: "Whats something really cool about your project timeline?" We responded: "Our super-reasonable task time estimates!"<br>
	To prove that what we thought was correct, we created a pair of graphs using data our 'Detailed Project Description Page' Work Log. <br>
	<i>For specific details and descriptions of each task, visit our <a target="_blank" ng-href="https://github.com/eburdon/EvolutionHub/wiki">GitHib wiki pages</a> for more info.</i>
	</p>
	<br>
		<center><img src="assets/img/stackedComparison.png" width="75%"></center>
	<br>
	<p>This is a great graph showing the relative amount of time estimated and spent on each task. As you can see, we predicted we would spent the most amount of time on adding remaining projects (once we figured out how to add the very first one). Unfortunately, having at least 1 project running turned out to be such a large task, that we weren't able to spent much time adding other projects. However, we do predict that will will still take the most amount of time, because even though we may have the technical learning curve out of the way, each project has enough variation that nothing can be easily copy/pasted.</p>
	<br>
		<center><img src="assets/img/directComparison.png"width="75%"></center>
	<br>
	<p>Here we can see a more direct comparison of estimated vs actual time spent. We gave ourselves lots of time to build the basic structure of the web page (build pages for the Education and research centers, create the home page template and color schemes, add the about page, etc...) but it didn't take nearly so long. Same thing for adding information to these places - the entire web application was built as modular as possible so that any edits - updates, additions, or removals - would be super easy. Unfortunatley, we didn't estimate ANY time for debugging and other "undefines".</p>

<div class="text">
	<h1>Threats to Validity</h1>
	<p>Usually, these kinds of threats only apply to research metholodgies, controlled experiments, so on and so forth. But here's a list of what we think could cause problems or break our application in the future:</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Unexpected updates to submodules:</b>  There could be an unexpected update to one of the student projects, such as a new, renamed, or deleted executeable script that we do not update in time. Thus, when users try to use this from our app, it won't work.</li>
		<li><b>Errors with submodule histories:</b>We've actually already run into this problem - if a submodule project reverts to a previous commit (essentially deleting that information), our application won't successfully push to Heroku (because there's information missing).</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</div>

<div class="text">
	<h1>Future work</h1>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Continue adding other project 1 and 2 to both "Question List" and "Codebase list" pages</li>
		<li>Continue with <b>Benchmarking</b> project idea and determine which evolutionary stage a project is in</li>
		<li>Ask development team to write summaries for their projects</li>
		<li>Ask development teams to format ALL their tool results in a visual manner so it's easy to display as a part of this application</li>
		<li>Add more projects to the research center</li>
		<li>Keep adding content to the education center</li>
		<li>Better application styling/design</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h1>The Grand Conclusion</h1>
	<p>Overall, this project was successful! Sure, we didn't meet our goal of being able to execute ALL project 1's from our web application (severe time constraints - we only had three weeks to work on this in addition to managing 5 other courses), but we did get at least one working before the deadline. We successfully built a modularized platform in which adding the remaining projects should be really easy. This is a well structured web application that truly shows the potential of this idea; this web application has great potential to be a learning hub for future Software Evolution Courses. The format and information added to the Education Center so far supports this in two ways: 1) The blog-posting style could be used for lesson plans in the future, and 2) links to useful evolution analysis tools, interesting evolution papers, and online books we read in the class have been included. Similary, the research center is cleanly separated into two perspectives, questions and codebases. From both, you can expand for more information about the idea and see the relevant projects you can run. Finally, this application invites user feedback by suggesting visitors to contact us by leaving a comment on our GitHub repository. One of the learning outcomes for this class was to use GitHub in a educational setting, and this is another way in which students can interact with the site.</p>
