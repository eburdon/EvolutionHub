	<h1>About this project</h1>
	
	<p>This application is our final deliverable for project 2 of UVic's Software Evolution Course. Cool, right?!</p>

	<p>Project 1 was to analyze different open-source codebases and answer questions related to evolution such as "Do software development methods, such as agile or waterfall, affect the long-term evolution of a project?" or "Does the amount of funding affect the number of features in a project?"</p>

	<p>This application hopes to successfully bring all of the student-created tools into one place. In our Research Center, you can execute the tool server-side, and have the results displayed right in your browser! In the Edcuation Center, you can learn all about the laws of software evolution, attempt to evaluate where your project is the evolutionary process, or follow a couple of cool links for more information.
